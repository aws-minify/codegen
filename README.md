# AWS Minify CodeGen
  
Based on [openapi-codegen](https://github.com/Mermade/openapi-codegen)

***Node.js-based codegen for OpenAPI documents. This project was initially a 24-hour hackathon. The local model adaptor code is entirely original and has been reverse-engineered from the existing documentation and template usage.***

**Work in progress**

**Generate one solution in a serverless stack with:**
+ AWS API Gateway REST API
  + AWS Secret Manager
    + AWS Lambda function 1
    + AWS Lambda function 2
